# Framework Selection

Based on the initial fleXRP project scope I will be using **Flask** in [PHASE_4.md](docs/PHASE_4.md).

## Rationale

* **Simplicity and Flexibility:** Flask is known for its minimal structure and ease of use. It's a great choice for getting a web application up and running quickly, especially if you're newer to web frameworks. This allows you to focus on the core functionality of fleXRP (XRP payment processing and fiat conversion) without getting bogged down in complex framework configurations.

* **Control:** Flask gives you more control over the project's structure and how you integrate different components. This can be beneficial as you're learning and want to understand how each piece fits together.

* **Faster Learning Curve:** Flask has a gentler learning curve compared to Django. Its documentation is clear and concise, and there are plenty of online resources available to help you get started.

* **Suitable for the Project Scope:**  While fleXRP will have a user interface, the core logic revolves around handling XRP payments and interacting with APIs. Flask's lightweight nature is well-suited for this type of application, where the focus is on backend processing and API integration rather than complex front-end interactions.

**When Django might be a better choice (in the future):**

* **Larger Scale:** If fleXRP grows significantly in complexity and requires features like a robust ORM, built-in authentication, and an admin panel, migrating to Django might become more appealing.
* **Team Development:** If you expand the development team, Django's more structured approach can be beneficial for collaboration and maintainability.

**For now, starting with Flask allows for:**

* **Building a functional prototype quickly.**
* **Gaining more experience with web development concepts.**
* **A focus on the core XRP and fiat processing logic.**
* **Easiy iteration and adding features as we progress.**

As we progress with fleXRP, we can always re-evaluate your framework choice and consider switching to Django if needed. But for this initial phase, Flask provides an excellent starting point.
