# Phase 2.5 Infrastructure: Production Deployment (AWS with Terraform, Lambda & Fargate)

This plan uses a combination of Lambda functions for asynchronous tasks and Fargate for the main application to balance cost-effectiveness and scalability.

### Step 2.5.1: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):

You'll need to create Terraform configuration files to provision the following resources:

* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Define your VPC, subnets (public and private), internet gateway, and route tables. Consider using at least two availability zones for redundancy.

* **Security Groups:** Create security groups to control network access to your resources. Restrict inbound traffic to only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS, the database port).

* **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** Provision a managed PostgreSQL or MySQL database instance. Configure appropriate instance size, storage, and backups. Choose a multi-AZ deployment option for high availability.

* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Create an S3 bucket for storing static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript).

* **Amazon API Gateway:** Create an API Gateway to act as a reverse proxy and handle routing requests to your Lambda functions and Fargate tasks.

* **Amazon IAM Roles:** Define IAM roles with appropriate permissions for each service (Lambda functions, Fargate tasks, API Gateway, etc.) to follow the principle of least privilege.

## Step 2.5.2: Application Deployment (Lambda & Fargate):

* **Payment Monitoring (Lambda):** Refactor your payment monitoring logic to run as a Lambda function triggered periodically (e.g., using CloudWatch Events). The Lambda function will connect to the XRPL, process transactions, and store the data in the RDS database.

* **API Endpoints (Lambda):** Create Lambda functions for your API endpoints (e.g., `/transactions`, `/xrp_rate`). These functions will handle requests from the API Gateway and interact with the database.

* **Main Application (ECS on Fargate):** Containerize your Flask application (including the `/transactions` and `/xrp_rate` endpoints). Deploy this application to ECS on Fargate. This ensures auto-scaling and minimal management. Use a load balancer in front of your Fargate tasks.

* **Deployment Pipeline:** Create a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline) to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your code.

## Step 2.5.3: Security and Monitoring:

* **IAM Roles and Policies:** Carefully configure IAM roles and policies to restrict access to your resources.

* **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Consider using AWS WAF to protect your API Gateway from common web attacks.

* **AWS CloudTrail:** Enable CloudTrail to log API calls and other activity in your AWS account. This is crucial for auditing and security analysis.

* **CloudWatch:** Configure CloudWatch to monitor the performance and health of your Lambda functions, Fargate tasks, and database. Set up alarms to notify you of potential issues.

## Step 2.5.4: Terraform Configuration Example (Snippet):

This is a simplified example; you'll need to expand it significantly.

```bash
# VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  # ... other VPC configurations ...
}

# RDS (PostgreSQL example)
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  # ... RDS configurations ...
  allocated_storage    = 20
  engine               = "postgres"
  engine_version       = "14.5"
  instance_class       = "db.t3.medium"
  multi_az             = true
  username             = "myuser"
  password             = "mypassword" #Securely manage this!  Don't hardcode!
  db_name              = "mydatabase"
}
```

## Lambda Function (Example)

```python
resource "aws_lambda_function" "payment_monitor" {
  # ... Lambda function configurations ...
}
```

## ECS on Fargate (Example)

```python
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "fleXRP-cluster"
}
#... more ECS & Fargate configs ...
```

This detailed plan provides a robust foundation for your AWS deployment. Remember to replace placeholder values with your specific configurations. Consult the AWS documentation for detailed instructions on each resource and service. Terraform modules can simplify the configuration and management of resources. Remember to thoroughly test and monitor your application in the cloud environment.
