'''
Improved monitor_payments function incorporating the refinements described in Phase 2. 
This version includes transaction validation, filtering, and persistent storage using SQLite
Remember to install the necessary libraries: xrpl-py, sqlite3, and requests.
This also assumes you have a get_xrp_to_usd_rate() function (from previous phases) to convert XRP to USD.
Error handling is kept relatively simple here for clarity, but should be expanded for production use.

This refined monitor_payments function is more robust and includes essential features for a production environment.
Remember to adapt error handling and logging to your specific needs and integrate it properly into your Flask application.
Consider adding retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors (like XRPL connection issues) and more
sophisticated database error handling.
The minimum amount check is just an example; you may need to adjust it based on your requirements.
Remember to handle potential KeyError exceptions when accessing transaction data to prevent crashes.

Example usage:
Replace "YOUR_MERCHANT_ADDRESS" with the actual address.
merchant_address = "YOUR_MERCHANT_ADDRESS"
monitor_payments(merchant_address)
